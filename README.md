# Priority Event Synapse Prototype

This project implements the Synapse Chart described in the dashboard plan using React, Vite, and `react-force-graph-2d`. It renders a force-directed view with category filters, a time slider, searchable nodes, tooltips, and double-click expansion with synthetic data.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to interact with the chart. Use the filter pills, search box, and timeline slider to explore the network. Double-click a node to load additional neighbors.
